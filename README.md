# Pedestrian-Detection
Pedestrian Detection using Faster R-CNN on pre-trained resnet50 model.

The project is a part of the course ECE613 offered at the University of Waterloo. I did an in-depth analysis and presented a review paper with 2 more classmates(Smit and Vidushi).

Created the code in [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gautypro/ece-613-research-project/notebook) using the dataset [Self-Driving Cars](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alincijov/self-driving-cars)
